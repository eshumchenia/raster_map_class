# raster_map_class

this repo contains a script for producing raster maps with corresponding histogram "legends" for three classification schemes: quantiles, standard deviation, and equal interval. each map class is coded with a color that corresponds to the colors in each map's histogram, to better visualize the distribution of observations in a map.
